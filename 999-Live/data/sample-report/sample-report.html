<p id='4' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Bitumen cargo values gained across Europe and Asia-Pacific,<br>boosted by a jump in crude and fuel oil values.</p>
<br><p id='5' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Domestic truck prices across Europe also mostly<br>strengthened as October started.</p>
<br><p id='6' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Cargo premiums to high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Rot-<br>terdam and the Baltics fell by $2-3/t, but outright values<br>continued to rise, while in the Mediterranean premium<br>values were steady on the week as refiners held their ground<br>amid rising outright values and slowing demand.</p>
<br><p id='7' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The Asia-Pacific bitumen market remained mostly firm,<br>despite the expected slowdown due to the week-long break<br>in China for Golden Week holidays.</p>
<br><p id='8' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The continued buoyancy in crude and HSFO prices in the<br>Asia-Pacific region pushed refiners to either seek price hikes<br>or mull production cuts at their units. Supply for October<br>was seen to be balanced in key export export locations like<br>Singapore and South Korea on the back of lower bitumen<br>production at some units.</p>
<br><p id='9' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Demand is expected to improve from Vietnam, Australia,<br>China and India in the coming weeks supported by seasonal<br>pick-up or the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.</p>

<h1 id='41' style='font-size:22px'>Summary</h1>
<br><p id='42' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Domestic truck prices strengthened in several markets,<br>many of those gains linked to monthly revisions for October<br>supplies, while cargo prices also jumped.</p>
<br><p id='43' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>While German domestic prices were assessed €10/t<br>firmer after some price erosion caused by plentiful supply<br>and high stocks being sold off during September, other key<br>northwest European markets like Benelux, UK and France<br>registered €20/t, £20/t and €20-25/t gains respectively.<br>But not all monthly deals between sellers and buyers had<br>been agreed and confirmed by 1 October, with more details<br>expected from 4 October.</p>
<br><p id='44' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Czech domestic and export prices also strengthened<br>on tight refinery supply, although there was still plentiful<br>availability overall in most central and southeast European<br>markets.</p>
<br><p id='45' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Sharp gains in fob Rotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO)<br>prices in the last week of September drove up outright<br>bitumen values, but such gains coupled with early signs of<br>winter and demand slowdown in parts of the Nordic/Scandi-<br>navia region encouraged a modest $2-3/t slippage in Rot-<br>terdam and Baltic cargo export premiums to HSFO that were<br>assessed at $25-30/t and around $20/t fob respectively.</p>
<br><p id='46' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Cross regional freight rates for standard 5,000t cargoes<br>were yet to be pushed down significantly, but slim assessed<br>declines took Thames-bound rates to $22-24/t from Rotter-<br>dam, $29-31/t from Hamburg, $47-49/t from Klaipeda and<br>$39-43/t from La Coruna.</p>

<h1 id='114' style='font-size:22px'>Summary</h1>
<br><p id='115' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Mediterranean bitumen cargo prices ended September<br>with sharp gains as high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices rose<br>substantially, while bitumen cargo premiums stabilised after<br>declining for much of the month.</p>
<br><p id='116' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Spanish export premiums to HSFO were assessed un-<br>changed at $20-25/t fob, Greek fob cargo premiums were<br>assessed unchanged at $15-20/t, with most Turkish export<br>flows indicated in the same range, while Italian fob cargo<br>premiums were also assessed unchanged at $15-20/t. The<br>impact of a lack of westbound transatlantic arbitrage op-<br>portunities, as well as a general demand slowdown within<br>the Mediterranean basin was leading to greater availabilities<br>across the region.</p>
<br><p id='117' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Delivered values into key north African markets were<br>falling, with some delivered premium offers in the low<br>$50’s/t into Algerian terminals in October, although most<br>indications into Algeria and Morocco were still in the high<br>$50s/t, while delivered Egyptian values for end-October<br>were also in the same high $50s/t to HSFO delivered area.</p>
<br><p id='118' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The gains in Mediterranean outright values made it yet<br>more unprofitable to move spot arbitrage cargoes to the US<br>east, with Spanish fob levels surging to around $460/t fob<br>during the last week of September, higher than cif US east<br>coast cargoes that were trading around $450/t.</p>
<br><p id='119' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Egyptian state-refiner EGPC awarded a further 5,000-<br>6,000t cargo to trading firm BGN at a $57/t delivered pre-<br>mium, basis Alexandria, for end-October delivery, additional<br>to the firm's original four-cargo tender awarded to Puma<br>Energy and 3B Trading.</p>
<br><p id='120' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Cross-Mediterranean freight rates were assessed $1-2/t<br>down on shorter routes and $2-3/t on the longer routes<br>amid clear signs of reduced demand for cargoes as well as<br>tankers to move them.

<br><p id='175' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The rise in prices is in part a result of higher crude<br>values and a weakening Turkish Lira, but market participants<br>also noted a slowdown in imports from Iraqi Kurdistan and<br>other Iraqi export points, with production lower in part<br>linked to rising vacuum residue feedstock costs and specifi-<br>cation issues on some bitumen grades.</p>

As a result,<br>bitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during<br>the same period.</p>
<br><p id='163' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in<br>domestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also<br>seen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of<br>VB feed prices.

<br><p id='204' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The 6,000t terminal — which will supply imported AC-10<br>and AC-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built poly-<br>mer-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants<br>— had been slated for completion by the end of this month.<br>Covid-related issues are understood to be partly responsible<br>for the delay.</p>
<br><p id='205' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Goil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coast<br>bitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yr<br>of bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. The<br>project was announced in 2017 and construction work began<br>two years later. It is now 94pc complete.</p>
<br><p id='206' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Once operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will be<br>fed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electri-<br>cally heated to keep the road paving product liquid before it<br>is discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks.</p>
<br><p id='207' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene-<br>butadiene-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacity<br>to produce 30 t/hour.

<br><p id='208' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>One domestic construction sector player said its use had<br>yet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways au-<br>thorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacity<br>of 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider use<br>in Ghana than PMB.</p>
